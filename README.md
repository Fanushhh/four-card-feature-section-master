### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow


### What I learned

I practiced a little bit more with the CSS Grid layout system and it is definitely interesting but it will take me some time to digest it properly being used to Flexbox, I feel like I don't need it but 
it is definitely good and both of them have their uses.
